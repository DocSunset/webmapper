<h1>Grid View</h1>

<h2>Instructions:</h2> 

<p>The grid view divides the interface into two constructions: The "DEVICES GRID" on the left, and the "SIGNALS GRID" on the right.</p>

<p>When the grid view is initialized, both grids are visible; the devices grid is populated by all devices declared on the network, and the signals grid is initially empty.</p> 

<p>To make connections between signals, devices must first be added to the signals grid. To do this, 
select a device's label (or a cell corresponding to a pair of devices) and then press the "Add" button; signals of 
the added devices will then be displayed in the signals grid. 
A device can be removed from the signals grid in the same manner using the "remove" button. 
Cells of devices that are included in the signals grid are indicated by a vertical or horizonal line.</p> 

<p>You can save the current view in the SIGNALS grid as a 'preset' using the "SaveNew" button on the top right hand side. 
Note that changes to the current preset will not be remembered unless you press the "Update" button.</p>

<p>Note the keyboard shortcuts below for changing the active grid, moving the selected cell, toggling cells, andloading presets, as they 
will enable you to use the interface much more efficiently. All keyboard shortcuts affect the 'active' grid, indicated by the little square in 
the upper left corner of each grid.</p>

<p>*Grid view was developed and tested on Google Chrome only.</p>

<h1>Hive view</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>The hive plot is a method for visualizing networks. In this view, the upper half of the plot is designated for source devices, 
and the lower for destinations. In view mode 1, an adapted hive plot, each device is given its own axis. In view mode 2, a traditional hive plot, 
source/destination devices are grouped along a single axis.</p>

<p>Although designed mainly as an aid for visualization, this view also provides the basic functionality to configure connections. 
Mouse over a device or signal in the list on the left hand side (or in the plot) to highlight its connections. 
Select signals by clicking its name in the list (or its node in the plot). 
Once a source and destination signal is selected, you can create or remove the connection by clicking on the blue 
bar at the bottom (or by using the keyboard shortcuts).</p> 

<p>Connections on specific devices can be shown or hidden from view using the checkboxes in the list next to the device names.</p>


<h2>Keyboard Commands:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>c: connect selected signals</li>
	<li>d: disconnect selected signals</li>
	<br />
	<li>CTRL 1: switch to view mode 1 (adapted Hive plot)</li>
	<li>CTRL 2: switch to view mode 2 (Hive plot)</li>
